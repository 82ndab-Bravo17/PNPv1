Platinum Nuke Pro is highly modified Content Management System (CMS) with lots of new features, mods and other enhancements that takes you far beyond the basic Platinum version.

Featuring a massive range of new and exciting features including the ability to dynamically load CSS / JS files , Tags, Social Bookmarking, colorbox built in and CKeditor just to name a few, and allows for a wide range of extra addons such as modules, blocks, mods and themes to make your site look it best. The idea behind this project is to have a PHP Nuke based cms that is fully loaded without loosing security, speed or its flexibility. Platinum Nuke Development Team has been working very hard on upgrading the entire CMS to PHP 5.3+ and html4.01 compliance as well as upgrading several modules.
